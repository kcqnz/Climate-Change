    <h1>How does climate change affect the animals in africa</h1>

    <p> Climate change is harming animals by changing their habitats and food sources. Rising temperatures and weather shifts are affecting where the animals live, migrate, and breed. This makes it harder for many species to survive and leads to imbalances in nature.</p>

   <h3> Giraffes</h3>
  <p> Climate change is affecting giraffes in Africa by altering the availability of their food source, as the droughts and temperature changes impact the growth of trees and plants they rely on. Additionally, shifting weather patterns for giraffes to travel longer distances,increasing their vulnerability to predators and human encroachment.</p>
